# Reddit 2 Phone

This code, using Reddit's praw api module along with Pushbullet api, pushes top Reddit posts from any subreddit (sent as an argument) to your phone!

Nobody has time to go to websites and see whats happening! News, events, facts, updates .. they all want them ob their phone, that too using PUSH notifications!

This is the best way to ease.

The code currently relies on Reddit API, so works for all Reddit subreddits. Will soon update - to scrape any website and deliver content to your phone! :)

Usage: Ex -

python redditbot.py news
